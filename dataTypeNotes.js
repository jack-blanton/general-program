/* 
There are 8 data types in javascript

Numbers (both floats and integers)
    also infinity and NaN
BigInt
    for MASSIVE numbers that javascript cant comprehend which is made by using a lowercase "n"
String
    Letters, Words, Characters, Symbols treated like text made with quotes
    + with string attatches them together
    could also use 'stringoty' or `stringothan` for things like 'mr. smith's class'
    backticks `` allow you to embed variables into a string
        let myName = "Jack"
        console.log(`My name is ${myName}`);
    you can also put any operation using this thing
        console.log(`2 + 3 = ${2 + 3}`);
Char
    1 character, javascript doesnt have this
Boolean
    True or False
Null
    only has null which means nothing, empty or unknown
undefined
    undefined, no data assigned
Objects and symbols exist but they're not relevant or something

typeof fucntion lets you determine what type of info something is
console.log(typeof("sigma")) -> string
console.log(typeof(365)) -> number
